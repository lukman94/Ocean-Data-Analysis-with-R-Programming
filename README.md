This is the repo for my work in following the ['Ocean Data Analysis with R Programming for Early Career Ocean Professionals (ECOPs)'](https://oceanexpert.org/event/3973) by UNESCO/IOC Project Office for International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE).

It consists of:
  1. Several pdf files exported from R Studio for various modules in the course that were completed using the R language. These are named according to the respective modules.
  2. 1 pdf file and 1 Rmd file (R notebook) that represents the final individual project that is required to complete the course. This uses all the techniques learned from the course to analyse a vessel registry dataset.

Data files for the analyses are not included in this public repo.
